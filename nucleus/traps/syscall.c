	When this instruction is executed, it supplies three pieces of information to the nucleus:
	  • The type of trap for which a trap state vector is being established. This information will be placed in D2 at the time of the call, using the following encoding:
		0-program trap
		1-memory management trap
		2-SYS trap

	  • The area into which the processor state (the old state) is to be stored when a trap
	    occurs while running this process. THE ADDRESS OF THIS AREA WILL BE IN D3.

	  • The processor state area that is to be taken as the new processor state if a trap
	    occurs while running this process. THE ADDRESS OF THIS AREA WILL BE IN D4.

	The nucleus, on execution of this instruction, should save the contents of D3 and D4
	(in the process table entry) to pass up the appropriate trap when (and if) it occurs while running this process.
